problem 1:
URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

// seperate sentence by spaces
// join back together replacing spaces with %20
// return result

function (string) {
  const result = string.split(' ').join(%20);
  return result;
}
